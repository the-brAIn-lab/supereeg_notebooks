# How to run these notebooks

You will need to run these notebooks from an environment which has the 
correct version of supereeg installed, as well as all its dependencies.
As of the time of writing of this readme, the deepdish library has a bug 
which is easily corrected.

To install the correct version, clone the supereeg fork from
    https://github.com/the-brAIn-lab/supereeg
and checkout the branch 'adam'. Then install this package to your
environment, eg 'conda develop ./supereeg' along with the dependencies,
using a similar method to install a debugged version of deepdish. You
could surely use another updated version of supereeg the same.

Finally, launch jupyter notebook or jupyter lab from your environment and 
run the notebooks in the virtual server.
